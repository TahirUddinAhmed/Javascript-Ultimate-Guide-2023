In JavaScript, operators are symbols or keywords used to perform various operations on values or variables. JavaScript supports a wide range of operators that can be categorized into different types based on their functionality. Here are the main types of operators in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic Operators
   +         Addition
   -         subtraction
   *         multiplication
   /         division
  **         exponentiation
   %         modulus
  ++         increment
  --         decrement

2. Assignment Operators
  =          x = y
  +=         x = x + y
  -=         x = x - y      
  *=         x = x * y      
  /=         x = x / y      
  %=         x = x % y      
  **=         x = x ** y  

3. Comparison Operators

  ==         equal to
  !=         not equal to 
  ===        equal to(value and type equality)
  !==        not equal to (Value or type inequalit)
  >          greater than
  <          less than
  <=         less than or equal to
  >=         greater than or equal to

4. Logical Operators: 
  
  &&         Logical and
  ||         Logical OR 
  !          Logical NOT 

5. Typeof Operator
  typeof()    returns a string that represents the data type of a variable.
