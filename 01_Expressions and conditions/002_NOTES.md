Ternary Operator -
   The ternary operator is a shorthand conditional operator that allows you to write compact if-else statements. It also know as the conditional operator. 
   The syntax for ternary operator is:

      codition ?  expresion1 : expression2;

   Here's how it works
     1.. The 'condition' is an expression that evalutes to either true or false..
     2. if the 'condition' is true, the ternary operator returns the value of 'expression1'
     3. if the 'condition' is false, the ternary operator returns the value of 'expression2'.
