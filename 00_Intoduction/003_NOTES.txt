var VS let in javascript 
  1. Var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped.
  2. var can be updated & re-declared within its scope.
  3. let can be updated but not re-declared.
  4. Const can neither be updated nor be re-declared.
  5. Var variables are initialized with undefined wheras let and const variables are not initialized.
  6. Const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var. // const author; // NOT allowed
